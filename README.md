# FoursquareClone with Parse

Hello GitHub ðŸ‘‹
This is my Foursquare Clone application.

I prefer Parse for every process which I wait for realtime database and I also made a Instagram Clone use with Firebase so I want to understand what is the diffrence between with this to technologies.


__Functions of this Clone__<br/>

-Get users locations<br/>
-Pin users locations<br/>
-Use navigation for this<br/> 
-Different users can see each others pins<br/>
